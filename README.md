PNG FreeNet PRO uses existing connection protocols such as SSH2.0.

All traffic generated between the client and the server is protected with SSH2.0.

Through the application it is possible to customise the start of the connection (we call injection) with typed connection text (HTTP standard or any other), or setting an SNI to perform handshaking with the server.

This is very useful for bypassing restrictions imposed by your  internet service providers or any network that you are using during the connection.
